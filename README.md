## Introduction
OpenCameraTrigger is a DIY project designed to enable wireless control of camera functions using an ESP32 microcontroller. With this project, you can send volume control signals to trigger your camera's shutter remotely.

---

## Features
- Wireless camera control via Bluetooth.
- Compact and portable design.
- Easy to customize and extend functionality.
- Open-source code and 3D-printable enclosure.

*(Add images and descriptions showcasing the device and its use cases.)*

## How to Build Your Own OpenCameraTrigger

### 1. Required Components
Here is a list of components you'll need to build this project:
- **ESP32-C3 Mini Module** (e.g., ESP32-C3 Super Mini) â€“ [Buy here](#)
- Push button(s)
- Micro USB cable
- Breadboard and wires (for prototyping)
- 3D-printed enclosure (files provided)

*(Add detailed descriptions and links to sources for purchasing.)*

---

### 2. Setting Up the Development Environment
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:
1. Install Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO).
2. Add the ESP32 board package to the IDE.
3. Install necessary libraries (e.g., BLE, HID).

*(Provide specific instructions or links to guides.)*

---

### 3. Coding and Running
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `.ino` file in your IDE.
3. Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
4. Compile and upload the code.
5. Monitor the Serial Output to verify functionality.

### 4. Wiring and Connection Diagram
Below is the connection diagram for the project:

*(Include a clear and labeled diagram showing button connections to the ESP32 GPIOs and power.)*

---

### 5. 3D Printing and Assembling the Enclosure
1. Print the provided `.stl` files using a 3D printer.
2. Gather additional assembly parts (e.g., screws, adhesives).
3. Follow the instructions to fit the ESP32 module and buttons into the enclosure.

*(Include an assembly guide with images or diagrams.)*
